When updating the project

- Always check if README.md needs to be updated after making changes to the project
- Update README.md when:
  - New features are added
  - Project structure changes significantly
  - New dependencies or tools are introduced
  - Main functionality changes
- Keep README.md concise and focused on essential information
- Use the same language as the project (Arabic in this case)
